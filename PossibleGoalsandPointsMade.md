# Possible Goals

This file contains notes from the rfced-future list that various people have stated are things they would
like to see the group focus on as we consider the evolution of the RFC Editor function.  This file is simply
notes, has **no normative value**, and should not be added to without a reference to the mailing list archive.
Duplicates are not necessary.  The group will not agree to all of these points, and some may not even be at all in scope.
A great many may be left untouched, and some of them may have been understood by the person writing this file.  When in doubt,
[Go read the mail archive](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/rfced-future/?so=frm).

## An attempt at a summary of below.

### The role(s)
* Sets strategy?
* Having an understanding of archival tools is important for the role
* What technical capabilities should the RFC Editor be expected to have
* Responsibility for the RPC and its budget?
* Authority to impose minimum standards for editing of docs
* Tooling responsibility?
* Responsibility to set publishing standards?
* Compliance with publication standards?

### Relationships and lines of responsibility, and transparency

### What we want from the series
* Record agreements
* Timely publication
* Copy editing can slow that process
* Role should fit existing organizational structure
* Bespoke tooling is a bug not a feature
* Should we worry about legacy?
* What happens to the series if the IETF disappears
* What happens to the IETF if the series disappears
* Ease of navigation?
