# Introduction

NOTE NOTE NOTE This document is a work in progress. Although it is 
intended to describe consensus forged in the RFCED-Future Program, 
many aspects are not yet settled; as a result, this document contains 
proposals and conjectures that do not yet have consensus.

Documents in the Request for Comments (RFC) series have been continually
published since 1969 {{RFC8700}}. The processes and organizational models for
publication of these documents have changed significantly over the
years. Most recently, in 2009 {{RFC5620}} defined the RFC Editor Model
(Version 1) and in 2012 {{RFC6635}} defined the RFC Editor Model
(Version 2), since modified slightly in 2020 by {{RFC8728}}.

In order to provide a sustainable basis for continued publication of the 
RFC series, this document describes Version 3 of the RFC Editor model, 
which divides the responsibilities for the RFC series among four primary 
functions: the IETF Administration LLC (IETF LLC), the RFC Series Working Group (RSWG), 
the RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB), and the RFC Publication Center (RPC).


# Conventions and Definitions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Overview of the Model

Version 2 of the RFC Editor Model {{RFC8728}} specified a structure
consisting of the RFC Series Editor, the RFC Production Center, and the
RFC Publisher, with oversight provided by the RFC Series Oversight
Committee (RSOC) on behalf of the Internet Architecture Board (IAB).

Discussion within the RFCED-Future Program has led in the direction of a
more consensus-oriented structure (similar in some respects to the
structure of technical work within the IETF) that retains roles for
specialized expertise in document editing and publication.

Specifically, this document defines a structure in which ultimate
authority lies with the IETF LLC, which is the 
corporate home for the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Internet 
Architecture Board (IAB), and the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF). 

The IETF LLC shall exercise oversight regarding ongoing operation of the 
final editorial and publication processes that lead to publication of 
documents in the RFC series. As in Version 2, these processes are the 
responsibility of the RFC Production Center (RPC) function. 

The IETF LLC shall also provide a structure for defining policies regarding
the RFC series. This document specifies such a structure through a new
RFC Series Working Group (RSWG), which shall submit its policy proposals 
to a new RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB).


# Ongoing Operation

Continuing publication of RFCs shall be handled by the RFC Production
Center (RPC) function in accordance with current policies in force or
future policies defined as specified in the next section of this
document.

This document does not specify the exact relationship between the IETF LLC 
and the RPC function; for example, the RPC function could be provided 
by a separate corporate entity under contract to the IETF LLC, it could 
be performed by employees of the IETF LLC, or the IETF LLC could work with 
independent contractors for some or all aspects of the RPC function. The
exact relationship is a matter for the IETF LLC and its Executive Director 
to determine.

The IETF LLC has authority over negotiating performance targets for the 
RPC and also has responsibility for ensuring that those targets are 
adhered to. The IETF LLC is empowered to appoint a manager or to convene 
a committee that is responsible for this oversight function.

Community members who have concerns about the performance of the RPC
can request that the IETF LLC look into the matter. If the IETF
LLC opts to delegate the oversight function, concerns can be raised
with the IETF LLC. The IETF LLC is ultimately responsible to the
community via the mechanisms outlined in its charter.


# Policy Definition

Policies governing the RFC series as a whole shall be defined in the
open through proposals that are generated by and discussed within the RFC
Series Working Group (RSWG) and then approved by the RFC Series Approval
Board (RSAB).

Policies under the purview of the RSWG and RSAB might include but
are not necessarily limited to document formats, tooling, processes for 
publication and dissemination of RFCs, and overall management of the RFC 
series.


## Structure and Roles

### RFC Series Working Group (RSWG)

The RFC Series Working Group (RSWG) shall
formulate proposals regarding policies governing the RFC series. The
intent is that the RSWG operate in a way similar to working groups 
in the IETF and research groups in the IRTF. Therefore, all RSWG 
meetings shall be open to any participant, subject to intellectual 
property policies which must be consistent with those of the IETF
{{RFC8179}}. At the initial formation of the RSWG, all discussions 
shall take place on an open mailing list, and anyone is welcome to 
participate in discussions on that list. The RSWG may decide by 
rough consensus to use additional forms of communication (e.g., 
GitHub as specified in {{RFC8874}}) that are consistent with 
{{RFC2418}}. The RSWG shall conform itself to an anti-harassment 
policy consistent with {{RFC7154}} and {{RFC7776}}.

The IETF Chair and the Independent Submissions Editor shall each 
appoint and oversee a co-chair of the RSWG. 

All interested parties are welcome to participate in the RSWG. This
includes participants in the IETF and IRTF, IAB and IESG members, RFC 
authors, individuals who use RFCs in procurement decisions, and the
like. The IETF LLC Board members, staff, and the Executive Director are 
invited to participate as community members in the RSWG to the extent 
permitted by any relevant IETF LLC policies. Members of the RSAB are
also expected to participate actively in the RSWG so that they are
fully aware of proposals early in the policy definition process.


### RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB)

The RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB) shall act as
the approving body for proposals generated within the RSWG. The sole 
function of RSAB is to review policy proposals generated by the
RSWG; it shall have no independent authority to formulate policy on
its own.

The voting members of the RSAB shall be as follows:

* The IETF Chair, representing the IETF stream
* The IAB Chair, representing the IAB stream
* The IRTF Chair, representing the IRTF stream
* The Independent Submissions Editor {{RFC8730}}
* The RFC Series Editor/Advisor

OPEN ISSUE: Discussion continues within the RFCED-Future Program
regarding the number of members on the RSAB (e.g., whether each stream
shall have one representative, whether streams that generate more
RFCs such as the IETF stream shall have more member, etc.) as well as
the individuals who are voting members (e.g., IETF Chair or someone 
appointed by the IETF Chair, the RFC Series Editor/Advisor, etc.). 

The RSAB shall choose a chair from among its members using a method to
be determined by the RSAB. The RSAB is expected to operate via email 
and through any necessary tooling. THE RSAB shall keep a public record of 
its proceedings, including minutes of all meetings and a record of all
decisions.


## Process

### Intent

The intent is to provide an open forum by which policies related to the 
RFC series are defined and evolved. The general expectation is that all 
interested parties will participate in the RSWG, and that only under 
extreme circumstances should RSAB members need to hold "CONCERN"
positions as described below. 

Because policy issues can be difficult and contentious, RSWG
participants and RSAB members are strongly encouraged to work together 
in a spirit of good faith and mutual understanding to achieve rough 
consensus (see {{RFC7282}}). In particular, RSWG members are 
encouraged to take RSAB concerns seriously, and RSAB members are 
encouraged to clearly express their concerns early in the process and 
to be responsive to the community. All parties are encouraged to respect 
the value of each stream and the long term health and viability of 
the RFC series.

This process is intended to be one of continuous consultation. RSAB 
members should consult with their constituent stakeholders (e.g.,
authors, editors, tool developers, and consumers of RFCs) on an ongoing 
basis, so that when the time comes to consider a proposal, there should 
be no surprises. Appointing bodies are expected to establish whatever 
processes they deem appropriate to facilitate this goal.


### Specifics

The following process shall be used to formulate or modify processes related
to the RFC series:

1. A individual participant in the RSWG generates a proposal in the form of 
an Internet-Draft.
2. If there is sufficient interest in the proposal, RSWG may adopt the proposal 
as a draft proposal of the RSWG, much the same way a working group of
the IETF or IRTF would.
3. The RSWG shall then further develop the proposal. Members of the
RSAB are expected to participate in discussion relating to such proposals.
4. At some point, if the RSWG chairs believe there may be rough consensus 
for the proposal to advance, they will issue a working group last call.
5. After a suitable period of time, the RSWG chairs will determine whether 
rough consensus for the proposal exists. If comments have been received and 
substantial changes have been made, it is expected that additional last calls 
may be necessary.
6. Once consensus is established in the RSWG, the chairs shall issue a 
community call for comments. Should substantial comments be received,
the RSWG will again consider those comments and make revisions as they see 
fit. At this same time, the RSAB will consider the proposal. OPEN
ISSUE: specify what counts as a "community call for consensus".
7. Should substantial changes be made, additional community calls for comment 
should be issued, and again comments considered.
8. Once all comments have been been addressed, the RSWG chairs will
submit the proposal to the RSAB for its consideration.
9. Within a reasonable period of time, the RSAB will then poll on the 
proposal. Positions may be as follows:
* "YES": the proposal should be approved
* "CONCERN": the proposal raises substantial concerns that must be addressed.
* "RECUSE": the person holding the position has a conflict of interest.

Anyone holding a "CONCERN" position MUST explain their concern to the community in detail. The explanation may or may not be actionable.

A CONCERN may be made for two reasons:

 * The proposal represents a serious problem for the group a particular member represents.
 * The member believes that the proposal would cause serious harm to the overall series, including harm to the long term health and viability of the series.

No CONCERN should ever come as a surprise to the RSWG.

10. If a CONCERN exists, discussion will take place within the RSWG. 
Again, all RSAB members MUST participate.
11. If all CONCERN positions are addressed, then the proposal is approved. 
Again, if substantial changes have been made, an additional call for 
community input should be made.
12. If, after a suitable period of time, any CONCERN positions remain, 
a formal vote of the RSAB is taken. If a majority of RSAB members 
vote to approve, the proposal is approved. Otherwise, it is returned to 
the RSWG. In the case of a tie, the proposal is approved.
13. When a proposal is approved, a notification is sent to the community, 
and the document enters the queue for publication as an RFC.

OPEN ISSUE: In which stream {{RFC8729}} are these documents published?
Is a new stream (e.g., the "Editorial Stream") needed?

### Appeals of RSAB Decisions

Appeals of RSAB decisions may only be made based on process failures, 
and not on the substance of a proposal. These appeals SHALL be made to 
the ISOC Board of Trustees within thirty days of the RSAB decision. The 
ISOC Board of Trusteers MAY decide only whether a process failure occurred, 
and what if any corrective action should take place.


# RFC Series Editor/Advisor (RSEA)

OPEN ISSUE: Discussion continues within the RFCED-Future Program
regarding the roles and responsibilities of an expert in technical
publication processes. To retain flexibility (e.g., as to whether this
individual plays more of an advisory role or more of a singular 
leadership role), this document temporarily refers to the individual 
as the "RFC Series Editor/Advisor" ("RSEA").

The RFC Series Editor/Advisor (RSEA) shall be a senior professional 
with deep knowledge of technical publishing.

The primary responsibilities of the RSEA are as follows:

* Provide expert advice regarding policy proposals within the RSWG.
* Serve as a voting member on the RSAB (see OPEN ISSUE above).
* If requested, provide expert advice to the RPC and IETF LLC.

Matters on which the RSEA might be consulted could include proposed 
changes to the RFC style guide, RFC formatting in general, web 
presence, copyright matters, and archiving policy.


## RSEA Selection

The RSEA will be selected by a committee formed by the Executive Director 
of the IETF LLC, taking into account the [role definition](https://github.com/intarchboard/program-rfced-future/blob/master/Issue12-RSE-role.md) 
and any detailed job description defined by the relevant parties (e.g., 
the Executive Director, other RSAB members, or RSWG chairs). The search 
committee may ask others to take part in the selection process in 
confidence. The initial length of service shall be for one year, but 
then further extensions will be for three to five years.

## RSEA Ongoing Performance Evaluation

Periodically, the Executive Director will send out to the community a 
call for input on the performance of the RSEA. The evaluation will be 
based on criteria specified in the role definition. Criteria could
include matters such as the following:

* Was the RSEA an active participant in RSWG/RSAB discussions and meetings?
* Did the RSEA provide useful advice to the RSWG and RPC?  
* Did the RSEA exercise good judgment in RSAB decision making?
* Was the RSEA effective in advising the community on policy direction?

The Executive Director will review the feedback, consulting with stream 
manager representatives, and then produce a recommendation to the IETF LLC 
Board. The LLC will then make a decision, taking into account the
Executive Director's recommendation.

Whether the RSEA role is structured as a contractual or employee relationship 
is a matter for the IETF LLC and its Executive Director to determine.


# Changes from Version 2 of the RFC Editor Model

## RFC Series Editor

The RSWG and RSAB together provide a public process by which policies 
for the RFC series can be defined. It is expected that these
bodies will therefore cover some of the responsibilities of the RFC
Series Editor under Version 2.


## RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC)

In practice, the relationships and lines of authority and responsibility
between the IAB, RSOC, and RSE have proved unwieldy and somewhat opaque.
To overcome some of these issues, this document dispenses with the RSOC.
