# Introduction

NOTE: This document is very much a work in progress. Although it is 
intended to describe consensus forged in the RFCED-Future Program, 
many aspects are not yet settled; as a result, this document contains 
proposals and conjectures that do not yet have consensus.

Documents in the Request for Comments (RFC) Series have been continually
published since 1969. The processes and organizational models for
publication of these documents have changed significantly over the
years. Most recently, in 2009 {{!RFC5620}} defined the RFC Editor Model
(Version 1) and in 2012 {{!RFC6635}} defined the RFC Editor Model
(Version 2), since modified slightly in 2020 by {{!RFC8728}}.

In order to provide a sustainable basis for continued publication of the 
RFC series, this document describes Version 3 of the RFC Editor model, 
which divides the responsibilities for the RFC Series into three primary 
functions: the RFC Series Working Group (RFCSWG), the RFC Series Approval 
Board (RFCSAB), and the RFC Editing and Publication Center (REPC).


# Conventions and Definitions

document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
