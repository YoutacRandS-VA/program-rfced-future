# Introduction

NOTE: This document is very much a work in progress. Although it is 
intended to describe consensus forged in the RFCED-Future Program, 
many aspects are not yet settled; as a result, this document contains 
proposals and conjectures that do not yet have consensus.

Documents in the Request for Comments (RFC) series have been continually
published since 1969 {{RFC8700}}. The processes and organizational models for
publication of these documents have changed significantly over the
years. Most recently, in 2009 {{RFC5620}} defined the RFC Editor Model
(Version 1) and in 2012 {{RFC6635}} defined the RFC Editor Model
(Version 2), since modified slightly in 2020 by {{RFC8728}}.

In order to provide a sustainable basis for continued publication of the 
RFC series, this document describes Version 3 of the RFC Editor model, 
which divides the responsibilities for the RFC series into three primary 
functions: the RFC Series Working Group (RFCSWG), the RFC Series Approval 
Board (RFCSAB), and the RFC Publication Center (RPC).


# Conventions and Definitions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Overview of the Model

Version 2 of the RFC Editor Model {{RFC8728}} specified a structure
consisting of the RFC Series Editor, the RFC Production Center, and the
RFC Publisher, with oversight provided by the RFC Series Oversight
Committee (RSOC) on behalf of the Internet Architecture Board (IAB).
Discussion within the RFCED-Future Program has led in the direction of a
more consensus-oriented structure (similar in some respects to the
structure of technical work within the IETF) that retains roles for
specialized expertise in document editing and publication.

Specifically, this document defines a structure in which ultimate
authority lies with the IETF Administration LLC (IETF LLC), which is the 
corporate home for the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Internet 
Architecture Board (IAB), and the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).  

IETF LLC shall exercise oversight regarding ongoing operation of the 
final editorial and publication processes that lead to publication of 
documents in the RFC series. As in Version 2, these processes are the 
responsibility of the RFC Production Center (RPC) function. 

IETF LLC shall also provide a structure for defining policies regarding
the RFC series. This document specifies such a structure through a new
RFC Series Working Group (RFCSWG), open to all members of the community,
which shall submit its policy proposals to a new RFC Series Approval
Board (RFCSAB).


# Ongoing Operation

Continuing publication of RFCs shall be handled by the RFC Production
Center (RPC) function in accordance with current policies in force or
future policies defined as specified in the next section of this
document.

This document does not specify the exact relationship between IETF LLC 
and the RPC function; for example, the RPC function could be provided 
by a separate corporate entity under contract to IETF LLC, it could 
be performed by employees of IETF LLC, or IETF LLC could work with 
independent contractors for some or all aspects of the RPC function.

IETF LLC has authority over negotiating performance targets for the 
RPC and also has responsibility for ensuring that those targets are 
adhered to. The IETF LLC is empowered to appoint a manager or to convene 
a committee that is responsible for this oversight function.

Community members who have concerns about the performance of the RPC
can request that the IETF LLC investigate the matter.  If the IETF
LLC opts to delegate the oversight function, concerns can be raised
with the IETF LLC. The IETF LLC is ultimately responsible to the
community via the mechanisms outlined in its charter.


# Policy Definition

Policies governing the RFC series as a whole shall be defined in the
open through proposals that are generated by and discussed within the RFC
Series Working Group (RFCSWG) and then approved by the RFC Series Approval
Board (RFCSAB).

Policies under the purview of the RFCSWG and RFCSAB might include but
are not necessarily limited to document formats, tooling, publication
processes, dissemination of RFCs, and overall management of the series.


## Structure and Roles

### RFC Series Working Group (RFCSWG)

The RFC Series Working Group (RFCSWG) is a new entity that shall
formulate proposals regarding policies governing the RFC series. The
intent is that the RFCSWG operate in a way similar to working groups 
in the IETF and research groups in the IRTF. Therefore, all RFCSWG 
meetings shall be open to any participant, subject to intellectual 
property policies which must be consistent with those of the IETF. 
At the initial formation of the RFCSWG, all discussions 
shall take place on an open mailing list, and anyone is welcome to 
participate in discussions on that list. The RFCSWG may decide by 
rough consensus to use additional forms of communication (e.g., 
GitHub as specified in {{RFC8874}}) that are consistent with 
{{RFC2418}}. The RFCSWG shall conform itself to an anti-harassment 
policy consistent with {{RFC7154}} and {{RFC7776}}.

The IETF Chair and the Independent Submissions Editor shall each 
appoint and oversee a co-chair of the RFCSWG. 

All interested parties are welcome to participate in the RFCSWG. This
includes participants in the IETF and IRTF, IAB and IESG members, RFC 
authors, individuals who use RFCs in procurement decisions, and the
like. IETF LLC Board members, staff, and the Executive Director are 
invited to participate as community members in the RFCSWG to the extent 
permitted by any relevant IETF LLC policies. Members of the RFCSAB are
also expected to participate actively in the RFCSWG so that they are
fully aware of proposals subject to their approval early in the policy
definition process.


### RFC Series Approval Board (RFCSAB)

The RFC Series Approval Board (RFCSAB) is a new entity that shall act as
the approving body for proposals generated within the RFCSWG.  The sole 
function of RFCSAB is to review policy proposals generated by the
RFCSWG; it shall have no independent authority to formulate policy on
its own.

The voting members of the RFCSAB shall be as follows:

* The IETF Chair, representing the IETF stream
* The IAB Chair, representing the IAB stream
* The IRTF Chair, representing the IRTF stream
* The Independent Submissions Editor {{RFC8730}}

OPEN ISSUE: Discussion continues within the RFCED-Future Program as to
whether the RFC Series Editor/Advisor should be a voting member or a
non-voting member of the RFCSAB.

OPEN ISSUE: Discussion continues within the RFCED-Future Program
regarding the number of members on the RFCSAB (e.g., whether each stream
shall have one representative, whether streams that generate more
RFCs such as the IETF stream shall have more member, etc.). 

The RFCSAB shall choose a chair from among its members using a method to
be determined by the RFCSAB. The RFCSAB is expected to operate via email 
and through any necessary tooling. THE RFCSAB shall keep a public record of 
its proceedings, including minutes of all meetings and a record of all
decisions.


### RFC Series Editor/Advisor (RFCEA)

OPEN ISSUE: Discussion continues within the RFCED-Future Program
regarding the roles and responsibilities of an expert in technical
publication processes. To retain flexibility (e.g., as to whether this
individual plays more of an advisory role or more of a singular 
leadership role), this document temporarily refers to the individual 
as the "RFC Series Editor/Advisor" ("RFCEA").


## Process

### Intent

The intent is to provide an open forum by which policies related to the 
RFC series are defined and evolved. The general expectation is that all 
interested parties will participate in the RFCSWG, and that only under 
extreme circumstances should RFCSAB members need to hold "CONCERN"
positions as described below. 

Because policy issues can be difficult and contentious, RFCSWG
participants and RFCSAB members are strongly encouraged to work together 
in a spirit of good faith and mutual understanding to achieve rough 
consensus (see {{RFC7282}}). In particular, RFCSWG members are 
encouraged to take RFCSAB concerns seriously, and RFCSAB members are 
encouraged to clearly express their concerns early in the process and 
to be responsive to the community. All parties are encouraged to respect 
the value of each stream and the long term health and viability of 
the RFC series.

This process is intended to be one of continuous consultation. RFCSAB 
members should consult with their constituent stakeholders (e.g.,
authors, editors, tool developers, and consumers of RFCs) on an ongoing 
basis, so that when the time comes to consider a proposal, there should 
be no surprises. Appointing bodies are expected to establish whatever 
processes they deem appropriate to facilitate this goal.


### Specifics

The following process shall be used to formulate or modify processes related
to the RFC series:

1. A individual participant in the RFCSWG generates a proposal in the form of 
an Internet-Draft.
2. If there is sufficient interest in the proposal, RFCSWG may adopt the proposal 
as a draft proposal of the RFCSWG, much the same way a working group of
the IETF or IRTF would.
3. The RFCSWG shall then further develop the proposal. Members of the
RFCSAB are expected to participate in discussion relating to such proposals.
4. At some point, if the RFCSWG chairs believe there may be rough consensus 
for the proposal to advance, they will issue a working group last call.
5. After a suitable period of time, the RFCSWG chairs will determine whether 
rough consensus for the proposal exists. If comments have been received and 
substantial changes have been made, it is expected that additional last calls 
may be necessary.
6. Once consensus is established in the RFCSWG, the chairs shall issue a 
community call for comments. Should substantial comments be received,
the RFCSWG will again consider those comments and make revisions as they see 
fit.  At this same time, the RFCSAB will consider the proposal. OPEN
ISSUE: specify what counts as a "community call for consensus".
7. Should substantial changes be made, additional community calls for comment 
should be issued, and again comments considered.
8. Once all comments have been been addressed, the RFCSWG chairs will
submit the proposal to the RFCSAB for its consideration.
9. Within a reasonable period of time, the RFCSAB will then poll on the 
proposal. Positions may be as follows:
* "YES": the proposal should be approved
* "CONCERN": the proposal raises substantial concerns that must be addressed.
* "RECUSE": the person holding the position has a conflict of interest.

Anyone holding a "CONCERN" position MUST explain their concern to the community in detail.  The explanation may or may not be actionable.

A CONCERN may be made for two reasons:

 * The proposal represents a serious problem for the group a particular member represents.
 * The member believes that the proposal would cause serious harm to the overall series, including harm to the long term health and viability of the series.

No CONCERN should ever come as a surprise to the RFCSWG.

10. If a CONCERN exists, discussion will take place within the RFCSWG.  
Again, all RFCSAB members MUST participate.
11. If all CONCERN positions are addressed, then the proposal is approved.  
Again, if substantial changes have been made, an additional call for 
community input should be made.
12. If, after a suitable period of time, any CONCERN positions remain, 
a formal vote of the RFCSAB is taken. If a majority of RFCSAB members 
vote to approve, the proposal is approved. Otherwise, it is returned to 
the RFCSWG.  In the case of a tie, the proposal is approved.
13. When a proposal is approved, a notification is sent to the community, 
and the document enters the queue for publication as an RFC.

OPEN ISSUE: In which stream {{RFC8729}} are these documents published?
Is a new stream (e.g., the "Editorial Stream") needed?

### Appeals of RFCSAB Decisions

Appeals of RFCSAB decisions may only be made based on process failures, 
and not on the substance of a proposal. These appeals SHALL be made to 
the ISOC Board of Trustees within thirty days of the RFCSAB decision. The 
ISOC Board of Trusteers MAY decide only whether a process failure occurred, 
and what if any corrective action should take place.


# Changes from Version 2 of the RFC Editor Model

## RFC Series Editor

The RFCSWG and RFCSAB together provide a public process by which
policies for the RFC series can be defined. It is expected that these
bodies will therefore cover some of the responsibilities of the RFC
Series Editor under Version 2.


## RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC)

In practice, the relationships and lines of authority and responsibility
between the IAB, RSOC, and RSE have proved unwieldy and somewhat opaque.
To overcome some of these issues, this document dispenses with the RSOC.
