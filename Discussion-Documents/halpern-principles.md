The following principles are understood to be important to the RFC series.  When reviewing documents from the RSWG that either change
these principles, or significantly change the  way they are realized, the RSAB members are expected to pay particular attention to:

a) whether the changes adversely affect the long term health of the RFC series; and \
b) whether the changes have received sufficient review and comment in the larger community affected by the RFC Series
