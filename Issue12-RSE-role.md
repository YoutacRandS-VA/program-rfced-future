# Role of the RFC Series Editor


This person will be a senior professional with deep knowledge of technical publishing.

The RSE will operate by providing expert advice to the RSAWG, and if requested, to the RPC,
on any relevant matters.  The value this individual provides is an understanding of the process
of technical publishing.  They expected to learn how the process is applied in the RFC series.
They will be asked to produce regular reviews of the process and identify problems and 
opportunities for improvement.  There are also opportunities to spontaneously learn of these
problems, likely the result of interactions with day-to-day operations.  The person may be
requested to draft documents

For example, the RSE might be consulted about proposed changes to the style guide, RFC
formatting in general, web presence, copyright matters, or archiving policy, or might of their
own initiative suggest such changes to the RSAWG.

The RSE is expected to attend all RSAWG meetings, and to have an ongoing working relationship
with the RPC and tooling team.
