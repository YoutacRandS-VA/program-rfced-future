Dear colleagues,

In March of 2020 the IAB kicked off the RFC Series Editorial Future Development Program, a program opened
to the entire community, with an eye toward reviewing the RFC Editor model.[1]  We are now coming to the
conclusion of our work, and the IAB will soon formally solicit community input, in accordance with
Section 3 of RFC 4845.[2]

The program has developed an evolution of the RFC Editor Model and a small change to the charter of the IAB.
You can find this evolution in draft-iab-rfcefdp-rfced-model-05.[3]  This draft brings together many different
points of view, as you can see from the mailing list archive.[4]

Here are some of the proposed changes that you may wish to know:


1.  We propose that the community oversees the evolution of the series by means of an open working group.
    Proposed changes that reach rough consensus will be reviweed by an RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB) that 
    consists of the RSCE and people representing the various streams.

2.  The RFC Editor role is changing to that of a consulting editor (RFC Series Consulting Editor or RSCE).  In
    this model, an expert will provide guidance to the community, the streams, and to the RPC to evolve the series.
    
3.  The IAB will no longer manage or oversee the RFC series.  The community and the streams will do that.  The IAB
    will continue to be in the appeal path if there are disputes.

There are a lot of things that won't change.  The RPC would continue to handle day-to-day functions of the RFC
Editor function, and authors should not see any change in terms of how RFCs are published.  They continue to be 
managed through the LLC.  We will continue to benefit from the expertise of a professional expert, now the RSCE.

Of course, there's a lot more detail that is specified in the draft.

This is what will soon be put forth for your comments.  In the meantime, even though the formal comment period is not
yet open, we invite you to review the model now and bring whatever questions you might have to the program when we meet
on Wednesday, November 10th, at 14.30 GMT at the IETF meeting.  Of course you can also join the mailing list [5] and
contribute your questions and comments there.

On behalf of the program,

Brian and Eliot
