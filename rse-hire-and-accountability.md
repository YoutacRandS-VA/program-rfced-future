# DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT

## RS[EA] Selection

The RS[EA] will be searched for and vetted by a committee formed by the ED, taking into account the [role definition](https://github.com/intarchboard/program-rfced-future/blob/master/Issue12-RSE-role.md) and any detailed job description that we further develop.  The search committee may ask others to take part in the selection process in confidence.  The initial length of service shall be for one year, but then further extensions will be for three to five years.

## RS[EA] Ongoing Performance Evaluation

Periodically, the ED will send out to the community a call for input on the performance of the RS[EA].  The evaluation will be based on criteria specified in the role definition.  Was the RS[EA] an active participant in all/most meetings?  Did the RS[EA] provide useful advice to the RPC and to the WG?  Did the RS[EA] exercise good judgment in terms of any role he or she would have had on the Approval Body?  Was the RS[EA] effective in advising the community on appropriate actions to take or not take?

The ED will then review the feedback, consulting with stream manager representatives, and then produce a recommendation to the LLC Board.  The LLC will then make a decision, taking into account that recommendation.

Whether the RS[EA] role is structured as a contractual or employee relationship is left to the LLC and ED to determine.
